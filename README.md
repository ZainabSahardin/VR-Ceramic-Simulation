# VR-Ceramic-Simulation
VR Ceramic Simulation (Gaming Elements and UI Design) using Oculus Quest 2

A learning application enriched by game mechanics to motivate the learner in practicing accurate pottery techniques. This project utilizes the Unity game engine to create a virtual reality system that simulates ceramic making. It aims to provide an alternative for people who want to learn and have hands-on practice without the need for materials, tools and workspace. The immersive experience and technical practice are enhanced by leveraging the hand-tracking capabilities of the Oculus Quest 2 technology.

This project focuses on guiding users to learn pottery step by step with more interactivity provided by gaming elements. Two modes are offered namely TUTORIAL and PLAY mode. Users will be guided through the step-by-step ceramic-making process in ‘TUTORIAL mode’. For the shaping process, the shape will automatically change after 5 seconds based on the guidance. The guidance is provided through a canvas displaying the steps and the 'ghost hand' will guide the user's hand. While for glazing and firing purposes, users can grab the object and follow the guides accordingly.

Users are free to create their own pottery design through ‘PLAY mode’. The shaping step in this mode allows users to deform the shape of the clay according to their hand. Next, they can view the glazing and firing process (through a simple animation).
